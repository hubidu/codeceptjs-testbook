# <testbook/> for CodeceptJS

## What is it?

Let's face it: Maintaining UI Tests sucks! When you are going fast, the application under test changes all the time
breaking the tests. But you can't be sure. It could still be a bug or maybe just
another case of a flakey test or unexplicable browser behaviour.
Since the tests are failing all the time, developers start to ignore them.
Product Managers don't care in the first place because they don't
understand what is being tested at all.

<testbook/> wants to change that by giving you a comprehensive view on your
test suite which you can share with all team members so that
everyone is on the same page.
